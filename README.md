## Developer Test

To run simply paste this command to terminal:

cd path/to/app

Then open browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000

### Notes
This is a very simple app with very simple design as my strong suit is back end coding.
When searching for the words red, green, blue or yellow, it will then show the poster of the movie, title, year of release, and runtime. The title of the movie will also be underlined with the matching colour.
There are lots of room for improvement (obviously) such as better design and use of services (interface). However I limit myself to 45 minutes so I kept everything pretty straight forward and simple.
